## Beyond Joke

Despite the original implementation being an empty shell with no functionality,
it got 40+ GitHub stars, which is way more than whatever I (@jiridanek) ever published on GitHub myself.
This shows the motivating idea of the package is fairly sound,
and some kind of a product-market fit should be there to be found.

Cypress itself is aware of the gaps, and they were even working on Puppeteer integration,
to, for example, let you juggle those browser tabs (see below).

Anyway, this fork is a take on the original idea to make it work for a narrower use-case relevant to the fork owner.

### What's wrong with Cypress?

* https://docs.cypress.io/app/references/trade-offs
* some limitations may get resolved in time
  * https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/299
  * https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/30756

### What's wrong with Playwright?

Playwright (by default) does not use real browsers, it uses its own browser implementations.

Playwright positioning is similar to Cypress: it's mainly a developer productivity tool and less of a QA testing tool.
Playwright is lot more QA department-friendly than Cypress, though.

## Install

```
# install this package using NPM
$ npm i -D cypress-playwright
# or using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-playwright
```

If using Cypress, add this package to your [Cypress support file](https://on.cypress.io/support-file)

```js
// TODO
```

VoilÃ¡ you can now run your Playwright tests in Cypress and Cypress tests in Playwright!
Plus use `await` keyword with all Cypress commands:

```js
// TODO
```

Want to open 2nd tab and test your chat application? No problem!
